Hi, Iâ€™m @Trochoide
I am an engineer an hobbiist, english is not my native language and I am located in Germany. 
I don't want to say, I am able to program, but I see the world in data and algorithms. 
I program (on a basic level) in c#, c++, java, turbo pascal (generations ago) and VBA (if needed). 
Professional I am a process engineer, specialised in CAD (Solidworks certified educator), 
structural mechanics of FRP an plastic-metallic interfaces. 
I hope, I can be of help and benefit and to receive such if needed.
